# Here you can edit messages and percentage gotten when heads are sold

# Percentage: How much of the user money is removed when redeeming
# Use a number 0-100, anything above or below may give errors
percentage: 20

# Choose to allow Placing Of Heads Or Disable It.
place-enabled: false
place-head: "You cannot place Heads"

# When a player tries to redeem their own head
own-head: "You cannot sell your own head"

# When a player sells a head
# You can now use:
# {player} - The name of the player's head you are selling
# {price} - The amount of money you will get for selling the head
sell-head: "You sold a {player}'s head for ${price}"
